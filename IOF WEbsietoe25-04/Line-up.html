              The Amsterdam based Yuri Boselie, alias Cinnaman, is rightfully known as one of the leading Dutch DJs of the moment. At an early age he stepped up behind the decks and his years of experience clearly come to the fore in his eclectic DJ sets. Cinnaman plays a wide range of styles and is never afraid to mix the known with the unknown. From house to hip-hop, from techno to garage: Cinnaman never hesitates to take risks in his sets and always draws for remarkable combinations and transitions.
By holding residencies at legendary venues Club 11 and Trouw for the last eight years, he can now call Amsterdam-based club De School his home. His eclectic style can also be seen in his variety of guests at De School.

              Student dorms aren’t the usual catalyst for great musical
achievements, but this is where Mark Haaxman and Lars Maasland better known as LarryKoek started their own musical journey.
They literally arose in the 80’s when two cute
little baby boys where
born somewhere in The Hague. Soaked with musical influences from
these days the baby’s developed rather quickly in to real music
lovers.

            Honoring their confusing name, contradiction has become the trademark of this up and coming band from Holland. To create a sound of their own the five-piece band skillfully demolished the walls between hip hop, jazz, funk, rock and reggae music. Sultry like a warm summer at times; but always pumping, roaring, and exuberant when performed live on stage.  </h2>
